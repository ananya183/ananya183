# Hi there, I'm Ananya ðŸ‘‹

<!--![Ananya's Avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107414694?v=4)-->

I'm a passionate student with a major in EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and a minor in Data Science Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal. Currently, I'm working in The Multi-rObot autONomy (MOON) Lab at IISER Bhopal under the guidance of Professor Sujit PB.

Presently, I am doing my Masters in EECS at IISER Bhopal.

### Research and Work

- **Research**: My research interests include autonomous systems, multi-agent systems, and drone simulations. I am working on a MARL project involving algorithmic methods for swarmations involving leader and follower drones using Unity and C# and implementing it on the Visual Reality Systems.
- **Publication**: I have an extended abstract selected for presentation at the ANTS 2024: 14th International Conference on Swarm Intelligence (Swarm robotics and swarm optimization) in Konstanz, Germany.

### Skills

- **Programming Languages**: C#, Python, C++, Java
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Unity, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MATLAB, Shapr3D, LaTex, Xanadu - PennyLane
- **Areas of Expertise**: Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning, Drone Simulations, Autonomous Systems, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision

### Projects

#### [Drone Simulation](https://github.com/ananya183/drone-simulation)
Developing a simulation involving leader and follower drones using Unity and C#. This project aims to explore the dynamics and control mechanisms of multi-agent swarm systems.

#### [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/ananya183/data-science-projects)
A collection of various data science and machine learning projects, ranging from basic exploratory data analysis to complex neural network implementations.

### Hobbies ;)

- Coding, Reading, Letter Writing and Stamp Collection, Playing Kalimba, Travelling, Basketball, Hiking, and yes, Sleeping ðŸ˜´

### Interests

- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Probability and Statistics
